Use the script 'plan' to invoke cbp-roller with the default configuration.
For other configurations see file README-usage.

The script 'plan' need 3 parameters:
- The domain file
- The problem file
- The output file

It computes solutions until the search space is completly explored or the execution is interrupted (for example, by using the ulimit command).
Each solution is stored in a different output file.
