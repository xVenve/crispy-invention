Objective of the practice: using the knowledge learned in the example applications: APP01 and APP02, program an application for editing restaurant orders:

- Pressing the [+] button will add the chosen product to the order and automatically update the Total.
- Pressing any of the [-] buttons will remove the product from the product list and automatically update the Total.

There is no need to create the branch, it creates itself.

Once the repository is created with everything in GitHub.

```
ng add angular-cli-ghpages
ng deploy --base-href=/<repositoryname>/
```
